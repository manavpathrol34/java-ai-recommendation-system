# Java Recommendation System Using Apache Mahout

## Overview

This project is a Java-based recommendation system that utilizes Apache Mahout to provide intelligent suggestions for products or content based on user preferences. The system is designed to demonstrate collaborative filtering techniques, particularly user-based and item-based filtering, to recommend relevant items to users. It is an ideal starting point for anyone looking to understand or build recommendation engines in Java using open-source libraries.

Apache Mahout is a powerful machine learning library that supports scalable implementations of algorithms used in recommender systems, classification, and clustering. In this project, Mahout is employed to process sample data and generate personalized recommendations.

## Objectives

* Build a fully functional recommendation engine using Java.
* Utilize Apache Mahout for machine learning-based recommendation algorithms.
* Provide product or content suggestions based on historical user preferences.
* Deliver a working demo with sample data for testing and evaluation.

## Features

* **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements user-based or item-based collaborative filtering using Mahout's APIs.
* **Sample Dataset**: Comes with sample user-item preference data to demonstrate how recommendations are generated.
* **Modular Codebase**: Designed with simplicity and clarity in mind to support learning and further enhancements.
* **Console Output**: Recommendations are displayed via a clean command-line interface.

## Technologies Used

* **Java** (Java SE 8 or later)
* **Apache Mahout** (for collaborative filtering algorithms)
* **Maven** (optional, for dependency management)
* **CSV file** (for storing sample user-item preferences)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-recommendation-system.git`

2. **Add Dependencies**
   Include Apache Mahout libraries via Maven or manually add the JARs to your project.

3. **Run the Application**
   Compile and execute the `Main.java` file to generate recommendations for a sample user.

4. **Customize the Dataset**
   Modify the `sample_ratings.csv` to include your own data for testing different scenarios.

## Sample Output

```
Top 3 recommended items for user 102:
 - Item ID: 501 (Predicted Preference: 4.7)
 - Item ID: 345 (Predicted Preference: 4.5)
 - Item ID: 678 (Predicted Preference: 4.4)
```

## Deliverables

* A working Java application demonstrating a recommendation system.
* Sample data and configuration to test the recommendation engine.
* Readable, well-documented code ready for experimentation or extension.
